//! Bedrock Edition network protocol for Mistvale BDS.
//!
//! Primitive codecs (varints, little-endian numerics, strings), NBT in Bedrock's
//! little-endian and network (varint) flavors, the compressed batch format, and
//! packet definitions for the protocol version below. This crate is
//! transport-agnostic: it consumes and produces the byte messages that
//! `mistvale_net` carries over NetherNet.
//!
//! So far it covers the batch framing ([`batch`]), the login handshake
//! ([`packets`], [`login`]) and the spawn sequence: StartGame, hashed block
//! network IDs ([`block`]) and chunk encoding ([`chunk`]). NBT is encode-only.
