//! NetherNet transport for Mistvale BDS.
//!
//! Serves the HTTP signaling endpoints (`GET /v1/join`, `POST /v1/join/{networkId}`)
//! on the server's TCP port, negotiates a WebRTC session per client (ICE, DTLS,
//! SCTP) over a shared UDP socket, and exposes each connection as a stream of
//! reassembled byte messages on the reliable and unreliable data channels.
//! It knows nothing about Minecraft packets; see `mistvale_protocol` for those.
//!
//! [`Listener::bind`] starts everything, and [`Listener::accept`] yields a
//! [`Connection`] once a client's reliable data channel is open.
